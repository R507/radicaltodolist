# Radical TODO List Server
This is an attempt to make simplistic python/react server which provides
TODO list functionality.

## How to use it
- Make sure you have python installed (checked only on python 3.8)
- `pip install requirements.txt`
- `python run.py`
- PROFIT!

## TODO
- react frontend pretty much missing atm
- fix few TODOs
- code cleanup
